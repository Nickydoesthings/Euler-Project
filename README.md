# Euler-Project

These are programs I wrote inspired by the Euler project (more info here: https://projecteuler.net/).
In essence, the Euler Project is just a collection of computational math problems to be solved by programmers.
Some of my "solutions" will be loosely inspired by problems and not necessarily restricted to just providing a number as an answer.

If you're learning math/coding I highly recommend you try your hand at these problems before seeing my solutions - I don't want to spoil the fun for you! :)
As per the rules of the Euler Project, I won't be including any solutions of problems above #100. 

Each of my programs is written in a Jupyter notebook which includes explanations - and sometimes further explorations - of the math and methods found within.

Enjoy!

P.S: For those wondering, Euler is pronounced like "oy-ler", and the project is named after mathematician Leonhard Euler.
