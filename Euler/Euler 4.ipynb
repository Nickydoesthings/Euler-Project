    "Here's another simple program wich works in the following way: first check every product of two 3-digits numbers to see if they're a palindrome. Then add each palindrome you find to a list. Then find the maximum of that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "My palindrome-finding-nested-for-loops  beginning on line 24 might be a little confusing so here's a quick explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "We *could* multiply 999 by every three-digit number, then do 998, 997, and so on. It can be seen that this method is inefficient, however, because it would have us checking the same numbers multiple times - for instance we'd check $999 \\cdot 150$ and then later check $150 \\cdot 999$. To avoid this, we just check the multiples of each number *below that number*. For example, when we iterate down to check $150$'s three-digit multiples, we only check $150 \\cdot 150$ then $150 \\cdot 149$ and down from there. Because, all the  multiples of $150$ *above* $150$ have already been taken care of. If that doesn't make sense, that's ok. This modified multiple-checking algorithm saves maybe fractions of a second and is probably a case of unnecessary optimization.\n",

    "This program holds *all* such palindromes in the list named palinList, so if you're curious to see the others, you can just print that value."
