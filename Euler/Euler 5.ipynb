    "You may notice that we begin at $20$ and iterate by $20$ - this means we only check multiples of $20$. This is to make our computation faster! Since we know $20$ must evenly divide our target number, that means our target number is some multiple of $20$. We want to keep these somputations under a minute max, so this simple modification is quite necessary (iterating by just 1 took my computer about 2 minutes)."
